//! A drop-in replacement for [`std::time::Instant`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/time/struct.Instant.html)
//! that measures time with high performance and high accuracy powered by [TSC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Stamp_Counter).
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! ```
//! let start = minstant::Instant::now();
//!
//! // Code snipppet to measure
//!
//! let duration: std::time::Duration = start.elapsed();
//! ```
//!
//! ## Platform Support
//!
//! Currently, only the Linux on `x86` or `x86_64` is backed by [TSC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Stamp_Counter).
//! On other platforms, `minstant` falls back to coarse time.
//!
//! ## Calibration
//!
//! [TSC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Stamp_Counter) doesnâ€™t necessarily ticks in constant speed and even
//! doesn't synchronize across CPU cores. The calibration detects the TSC deviation and calculates the correction
//! factors with the assistance of a source wall clock. Once the deviation is beyond a crazy threshold, the calibration
//! will fail, and then we will fall back to coarse time.
//!
//! This calibration is stored globally and reused. In order to start the calibration before any call to `minstant`
//! as to make sure that the time spent on `minstant` is constant, we link the calibration into application's
//! initialization linker section, so it'll get executed once the process starts.
//!
//! *[See also the `Instant` type](crate::Instant).*
