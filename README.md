A drop-in replacement for [`std::time::Instant`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/time/struct.Instant.html) that measures time with high performance and high accuracy powered by [TSC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Stamp_Counter).

## Usage

```toml
[dependencies]
minstant = "0.1"
```

```rust
let start = minstant::Instant::now();

// Code snipppet to measure

let duration: std::time::Duration = start.elapsed();
```


## Motivation

This library is used by a high performance tracing library [`minitrace-rust`](https://github.com/tikv/minitrace-rust). The main purpose is to use [TSC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Stamp_Counter) on x86 processors to measure time at high speed without losing much accuracy.

## Platform Support

Currently, only the Linux on `x86` or `x86_64` is backed by [TSC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Stamp_Counter). On other platforms, `minstant` falls back to coarse time. If TSC is unstable, it will also fall back to coarse time.

## Benchmark

Benchmark platform is `Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2630 v4 @ 2.20GHz` on CentOS 7.
